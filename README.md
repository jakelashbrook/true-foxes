deployed version of the site here

So some friends of mine have been asking me for a while to build them a new band website. They had been using services like 
Wix and GoDaddy GUI's beforehand and were not satisfied with the results because they felt limited in what they could achieve 
and didn't feel like it gave their website individuality. So when they learned I was studying Software Development with Code 
Institute they came knocking on my door for help to create a new internet home. With this being my first ever time creating a 
website for a band, we decided to have a meeting and talk about what the site would need and what they may like to add into it 
in future updates/releases of the site. 

## Meeting Notes for Site Development 


## The Boilerplate 

So to do this I decided to start with a basic bootstrap theme made by [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_theme_band.asp) for bands and use this as an initial boilerplate
to re-structure and re-style before building new content into the site.

## Design

**Typography**:  

**Colour Scheme**:  


# Testing 
To make sure that all testing is done thoroughly and throughout the development of the website, I have created a seperate document 
for all the testing carried out on this site.

# Credits 

## Code 
- [W3 Schools - Band Template](https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_theme_band.asp)  
This Bootstrap Template was used as an initial Boilerplate to speed up the design process of the website. The majority of code has 
been edited or replaced- This has just been used predominantly as a starting point for constructing a unique new band website.
- [W3 Schools - Back to the top button]()  
This code was used as the base for creating my 'back to the top button'.
